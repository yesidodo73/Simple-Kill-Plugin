### Clarification
The /kill command, as implemented in this plugin, only affects the player executing the command. It cannot be used to target or harm **other** players or entities.

### What Happens When You Use /kill?
When a player executes /kill, their in-game character immediately dies, setting their health to zero.
This command is helpful for players who might be stuck, want to respawn at their base, or need a fresh inventory without other intervention.
The plugin handles the process smoothly, ensuring no server lag or disruption during execution.
